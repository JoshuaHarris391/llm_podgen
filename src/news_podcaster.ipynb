      "title='The Looking Glass Go is a folding holographic display that fits in your pocket - The Verge' url='https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989675/looking-glass-go-holographic-display-kickstarter' description='The $300 Looking Glass Go is the company’s most affordable and portable volumetric screen yet, with a foldable six-inch body, higher pixel density, and built-in Wi-Fi.' content=\"By Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. We’ve been following Looking Glass for years — it’s one of the few startups dedicated to building 3D displays where digital objects appear to live inside or leap off the screen. In 2020, it introduced a cheaper 7.9-inch desktop model at $349, and today, it’s introducing its most affordable and portable screen yet: the $300 Looking Glass Go. With a six-inch screen that the company claims is 10 times thinner than previous Looking Glass displays, it’s the first one small enough to fit in your pocket — though you’ll need to plug in USB-C power or an optional external USB-C battery dongle, as it doesn’t have a built-in battery of its own. It’s also the first with built-in Wi-Fi (and also Bluetooth) to “receive holograms from the cloud.” The six-inch screen should have substantially higher pixel density than its 7.9-inch predecessor, too, at a new 1440 x 2560 (491ppi) versus 1536 x 2048 (325ppi). Whether that translates to clarity depends on other factors, too — though Looking Glass says it offers the same 58-degree viewing angles from up to 100 different perspectives as the 7.9-inch model. (Perspectives: like most autostereoscopic screens, the Looking Glass doesn’t beam a 3D image everywhere simultaneously. Your eyes have to be at certain angles to the screen to see it properly. That’s why some volumetric displays, including 2014’s New Nintendo 3DS, include face tracking, though face tracking can be less desirable when you want to show a screen to multiple people at once.) A note on crowdfunding: Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site. The Looking Glass Go is yet again a Kickstarter project, and the pitch is roughly the same as before — it’s a way to see 3D objects without putting on a VR headset, a way to view spatial photos you might capture with your phone, a way to view emerging forms of 3D images like NeRFs and Gaussian Splats, and perhaps even a way to interact with ChatGPT-powered holographic AI characters. You can see one such interaction in the company’s YouTube video atop this story — I’ll reserve judgment until I can try Looking Glass’ “Liteforms” for myself, but it does seem cool! Looking Glass is invested enough in the 3D content side of things that it’s actually developed a way to view 3D images without a piece of hardware like this, just by dragging your finger or cursor across images on the web. We embedded a few of the so-called “Looking Glass Blocks” into this Verge story. But you probably wouldn’t just leave a website open on your desk or pop it into your bag to show off on the go. If that’s something you’re interested in, the company is currently offering the Go for an early bird price of $199 on Kickstarter through December 6th, and orders should ship as soon as June 2024. Looking Glass says the device is made of steel, glass, and ABS plastic, weighs 235g, measures 0.76 inches (1.9cm) thick, and stands 6.3 inches (16cm) tall and 3.2 inches (8cm) wide. There are forward, back, and pause buttons for slideshows and a 3.5mm audio jack on the side. It doesn’t have a speaker. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily. The Verge is a vox media network © 2023 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved\"\n"

      "Raj Cybertech: Welcome to another episode of PodGen, where we decode the latest buzz in tech and innovation. I'm your host, Raj Cybertech, and today we're joined by two very special guests. First up, we have David Data, a tech analyst known for his sharp insights. Welcome, David.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: Thanks for having me, Raj. Excited to be here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: And we also have Sophia Algorithm, a futurist and tech ethicist who helps us understand the broader implications of tech on society. Welcome, Sophia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia Algorithm: Delighted to join the conversation, Raj.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: Let's dive right in. Our first topic is the Looking Glass Go, a folding holographic display that's making waves. David, can you break down what this gadget is all about?\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: Absolutely, Raj. The Looking Glass Go is a portable 3D display that allows you to view digital objects in three dimensions without needing a VR headset. It's got a six-inch screen with a high pixel density, and it's foldable, so you can literally slip it into your pocket. It's a fascinating step forward for volumetric displays.

      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. Sophia, what's your take on how this could impact our daily lives?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia Algorithm: Well, Raj, technologies like the Looking Glass Go could revolutionize how we interact with digital content. Imagine architects walking clients through a building design or doctors examining a 3D model of an organ before surgery. The potential is vast, but we also have to consider the challenges, like the digital divide and ensuring these advancements are accessible to all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: Speaking of impact, the gaming world is abuzz with the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. It's shattered viewing records on YouTube. David, what does this tell us about the intersection of tech and entertainment?\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: Raj, it's a testament to the power of anticipation and community. The trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI got 85 million views in just 22 hours, breaking previous records. This shows the massive influence gaming has on our culture and the tech that drives it.

      "Raj Cybertech: Now, let's shift gears to the OnePlus 12. David, can you simplify the specs for our listeners?\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: Sure thing. The OnePlus 12 is a powerhouse with up to 24GB of RAM and a 5400 mAh battery. It's one of the first devices with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, promising top-notch performance for users.

      "Raj Cybertech: Sophia, with such powerful devices becoming commonplace, how do you see this shaping our relationship with technology?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia Algorithm: Devices like the OnePlus 12 are blurring the lines between what's a computer and what's a phone. We're carrying incredibly powerful machines in our pockets, which means we're more connected and capable than ever. But it also raises questions about privacy, security, and our dependence on technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: Speaking of security, Microsoft is offering paid Windows 10 security updates for consumers. David, what's the significance of this move?\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: It's quite a shift, Raj. Typically, Microsoft has offered these Extended Security Updates to organizations, but now they're extending it to individuals. It's a clear sign that while they're pushing towards Windows 11, they recognize that many users are still reliant on Windows 10. [https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23988896/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-consumers-paid](source link)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia Algorithm: It's a balancing act between innovation and user needs. While we want to encourage users to adopt the latest and safest systems, we also have to meet them where they are. This move by Microsoft acknowledges that reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raj Cybertech: Lastly, let's touch on Discord's mobile overhaul. David, what's new with this popular communication platform?\n",
      "\n",
      "David Data: Discord's mobile app is getting a major facelift, focusing on ease of use for on-the-go communication. It's streamlining features like server navigation and message searching, and they've even introduced a dark mode called \"Midnight.\" [https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989155/discord-mobile-app-refresh-midnight-view](source link)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophia Algorithm: This update reflects how our digital interactions are evolving. Discord is adapting to the way people communicate today, prioritizing direct messaging and community engagement. It's a sign of how platforms must evolve to stay relevant.\n",
