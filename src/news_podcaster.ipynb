James Harden’s nightmare in Los Angeles reached an even uglier depths on Monday morning as the Clippers took on the Memphis Grizzlies. Against the worst side in the Western Conference, many expected the Clippers to snap their losing-streak. Watch an average of 9 NBA Regular Season games per week LIVE on ESPN, available via Kayo. Join Kayo now and start streaming instantly > But things went from bad to worse for the Clippers with Harden delivering his worst outing since joining the team in a high-profile trade from the Philadelphia 76ers. Despite a late comeback, the Grizzlies proved too good for the struggling Clippers as they secured the 105-101 victory. Harden finished his first contest in front of the LA crowd with 11 points on 4-12 shooting to go along with four rebounds and three assists. The numbers paint an ugly picture for Harden who ended with a plus/minus of -28 in 29 minutes of game time. In the 19 minutes he spent on the bench, the Clippers were +24. Highlighting the stark disparity in how much better they are without the 2018 MVP winner. Through his first four games with his fourth NBA team, the Clippers are -67 with Harden on the court and are +24 with him on the bench. It has seen basketball fans tear the 34-year-old star to shreds with many questioning if the Clippers need to make a change to their line-up.

Speaking before the Clippers’ loss to Dallas, Mavericks analyst Dameris unloaded on Harden in a scathing drive-by. “Listen James, have you ever had those friends who had bad roommates? Over and over again they complained about their bad roommates. “They never thought to be self aware enough that they’re the bad roommate, they’re the problem. “If this doesn’t work this year, in this system, with this team, then you’re going to go and point fingers at everybody else and you’re going to go home and start swiping right for another team. There’s not going to be anybody left because James, you’re not The Beard, you’re not the system — you’re the problem.” To make matters even worse for Harden was the fact that mere hours after his latest nightmare, his former team was firing on all cylinders. The man who took the keys as the Philadelphia 76ers point guard from Harden produced a historic display. Tyrese Maxey showed flashes of how bright his star can shine last season, this season he’s taken things to a whole new level. On Monday, against the Indiana Pacers, he went nuclear as he dropped 50 points to go along with seven rebounds and five assists. The scoring outburst sees him become the ninth player in Philadelphia history to register a 50-point game. Australia could soon have another player in the NBA after Duop Reath made the most of his opportunity, seriously impressing on debut. Aussie NBA star Ben Simmons’ comeback has taken a hit with the guard dealing with fresh injury concerns that spell disaster for his team. Philadelphia 76ers fans have been left in shock after a fan favourite was ruled out for some time after going for a walk near his home. Our Apps'\n"

      "# Tech & Tides Podcast Episode: \"Harnessing Tech for a Greener Tomorrow\"\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Host: Welcome to 'Tech & Tides', the podcast that brings you to the intersection of technology and environmental conservation. I'm your host, Alexa Reef, and today we have a special guest, Raj Cybertech, a seasoned technology reporter with a passion for how tech innovations shape our society. Hello, Raj, and welcome to the show!\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: Hi Alexa, it's great to be here. I'm excited to dive into today's topics and explore the future of tech and sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Convergence of Technology and Environmental Conservation\n",
      "Host: Raj, let's start with the basics. In your experience, how can technological advancements contribute to environmental conservation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: Absolutely, Alexa. When we talk about technology, we often think about gadgets and gizmos, but it's so much more than that. For instance, advancements in renewable energy tech like solar panels and wind turbines are making it easier and more affordable for us to reduce our carbon footprint. They're not just for tech enthusiasts or the wealthy anymore; they're becoming a part of everyday life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host: That's a powerful shift. And with climate change being such a critical issue, it's reassuring to see tech playing a role in the solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Benefits and Challenges of Tech Innovations\n",
      "Host: What about the challenges that come with these innovations? It's not always a smooth road, is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: You're right, Alexa. With every new technology, there are hurdles to overcome. Take electric vehicles (EVs) as an example. They're fantastic for reducing emissions, but we still need to improve the infrastructure for charging stations and figure out how to recycle batteries efficiently. It's a work in progress, but the potential benefits for our planet are huge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host: It sounds like a classic case of growing pains. New technologies need time to mature and integrate into society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: Exactly. And that's why discussions like this are so important. We need to understand both the opportunities and the obstacles to make informed decisions about our tech-driven future.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expert Opinions and Future Trends\n",
      "Host: Looking ahead, what are some predictions from experts about where technology is taking us, especially in terms of sustainability?\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: Well, there's a lot of buzz about the 'Internet of Things' or IoT. This is where everyday objects are connected to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data. Experts believe IoT can significantly improve energy efficiency in homes and cities by optimizing how we use resources. Imagine your fridge being able to track its contents and suggest recipes to minimize food waste, or streetlights that only turn on when they detect motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host: That's fascinating. It seems like the future holds a more responsive and interconnected world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: Absolutely, and while it sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, it's quickly becoming a reality. The key will be ensuring these technologies are accessible and benefit everyone, not just a select few.\n",
      "\n",
      "Host: Well said, Raj. And with that, we'll wrap up today's episode. Thank you for sharing your insights and helping us understand the complex world of tech and its role in environmental conservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guest: It was my pleasure, Alexa. Thanks for having me.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "Host: To our listeners, thank you for tuning in to 'Tech & Tides'. We hope you've gained a new perspective on how technology can help us build a more sustainable future. Until next time, keep making waves for change.\n",
